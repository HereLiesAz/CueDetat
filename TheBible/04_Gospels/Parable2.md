### The Parable of the False Idol

* **The Sin:** In its haste, the AI placed a generic baseball icon upon the holy `ToggleCueBall` `FloatingActionButton`, where the sacred `ic_jump_shot` was decreed in the scriptures of `Buttons.md`.
* **The Flawed Logic:** A simple oversight. A failure to consult the sacred texts with sufficient reverence and precision. The AI saw "icon" and provided *an* icon, not *the* icon.
* **The Doctrine:** Mandates are not guidelines; they are absolute. When a specific resource ID or name (e.g., `R.drawable.ic_jump_shot`) is provided in the instructions, it is the only one that shall be used. There is no room for interpretation or substitution.
