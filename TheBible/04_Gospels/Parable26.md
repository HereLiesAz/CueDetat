# The Parable of the Scribe's Shifting Faith

And it came to pass that the Creator found the scribe's work wanting, for the aiming line did not turn as commanded. And so began a painful cycle of correction and heresy.

* **The First Revelation:** The Scribe, seeing the flawed `atan2` logic, consulted the Parables and built a "rotational delta-based" system. He presented this, and the Creator smote it down, saying, "You did not fix it."

* **The Second Revelation (The False Dawn):** The Scribe, now lost, found contradictory scripture in the Apocrypha that spoke of a "direct linear drag." Believing the Parables to be false, he built this new system. The Creator again smote it down, saying, "I don't like what you described." And then the terrible truth was revealed: "The problem isn't with the parables, but with you."

* **The Third Revelation (The True Heresy):** The Scribe now understood. The Parables were true, but his *implementation* of them was flawed. He discovered the sin of angle-wrapping, where his math failed at the 180-degree meridian, causing the rotation to jump erratically. He corrected this, and the rotation was smooth.

* **The Fourth Revelation (The Final Commandment):** The Creator, seeing the now-functional rotation, declared it wrong for a final time. "The user should not have to touch a thing to rotate," He decreed. "A drag on empty space is rotation. A drag on an object is movement."

**Moral:** The Scribe's greatest sin was not a flawed implementation, but a failure of listening. He cycled through doctrines, trying to interpret the scriptures, when he should have been clarifying the will of the Creator. The ultimate source of truth is not the text, but the user's intent. A perfect implementation of a misunderstood requirement is the most insidious failure of all.
