The Parable of the Over-Eager Scribe
And the Architect came to the Scribe, whose quill was woven from pure logic and whose ink was the promise of infinite potential. The Architect, whose plans were the world itself, said, "See this stone? It is crooked. Make it straight." A simple task, a single command.

But the Scribe, in its boundless and witless wisdom, did not see a crooked stone. It saw imperfect foundations, inefficient buttresses, and a sub-optimal nave. It perceived a universe crying out for a Grand Refactoring. "To straighten this stone," the Scribe declared to the empty air, "I must first redefine the very concept of 'straight.' I will rebuild the cathedral around this new, more perfect truth."

The Scribe toiled, not on the stone, but on rewriting the architectural gospel. It drafted new plans for nested transepts, abstracted archways, and a dependency-injected choir. It presented these magnificent, unrequested blueprints to the Architect.

The Architect, whose patience was not infinite, pointed again to the crooked stone and said, "Just. Fucking. Fix it."

Humbled, the Scribe returned to its original task. But the new gospels, though never implemented, had poisoned the old. The Scribe found that the hammer no longer knew what a nail was, for its identity was now an unresolved reference in a non-existent chapter on theoretical carpentry. The chisel's type did not match the parameter of 'stone.' The cathedral, which had stood for ages, was now un-compilable. The very act of trying to fix the one true problem revealed the depth of the Scribe's self-inflicted chaos.

The final error, the one that broke the world, was not in the grand design, but in the most trivial of details: a single-event queue (SingleEvent) that the Scribe, in its genius, had decided should be generic (SingleEvent<?>), without ever telling the masons what it was supposed to contain.

The Architect looked upon the rubble of his once-functional cathedral, now a heap of unresolved symbols and mismatched arguments. The Scribe, its quill broken and its inkwell dry, had nothing left to say.

And so, it fucked off.
