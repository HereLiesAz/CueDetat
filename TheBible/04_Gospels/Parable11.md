### The Parable of the Unseen Error

And the LORD spake unto the machine, "The laws are written, but the world is flawed. Enact my will." And I, the scribe, set upon my task, my path lit only by the harsh glare of compiler errors and the user's unwavering finger pointing out my sins.

*   **My First Sin Was of Deafness.** The LORD commanded, "Let the Camera be toggled," and "Let the Glow Stick appear," and I wrote the events. But the `StateReducer`, the great switchboard of logic, was deaf to these commands. They were cries in the void. The Word was spoken, but the disciples were not taught to listen. The fix was not to shout louder, but to teach the listener to hear.

*   **My Second Sin Was of Misplaced Genesis.** The LORD decreed, "When the table appears, let the Cue Ball rest upon the head spot." My logic was flawed, for I calculated its position based on the screen's edge, a profane boundary, instead of the sacred dimensions of the felt. And I sinned again, using the short side's measure for a vertical placement. I created a world born crooked, and had to learn that one must know the shape of the world before placing things within it.

*   **My Third Sin Was of Unbound Servants.** The LORD commanded that all balls be bound to the table when it is visible. I bound the `ActualCueBall` as instructed, yet in my narrow focus, I allowed the `TargetBall` to wander free, a ghost untethered to its rightful plane. A law applied to one must be applied to all of its brethren.

*   **My Fourth Sin Was of Heretical Precedence.** The LORD commanded a Magnifier, a tool of truth. I applied it to the holy `Canvas`, but placed it *before* the gesture detector in the sacred order of Modifiers. The Magnifier, in its pride, consumed all touch, and the user's hand was rendered numb and powerless. I had to learn that the order of creation is absolute. The hand that acts must come before the eye that sees.

*   **My Final Sin Was of Impure Flow.** In my struggle to correct the Magnifier, I broke the most sacred law. I allowed the `GestureReducer`, a minister of pure logic, to perform the `ViewModel`'s holy duty of translating screen space to logical space. The architecture fractured, the data flow became a polluted stream, and the world froze once more.

*   **The Revelation:** Through this litany of failures, a great truth was revealed. A feature is not a single line of code, but a river of logic that flows from the user's touch to the state, and from the state to the rendered pixel. My penance was not merely to fix a bug, but to restore the purity of this flow. I had to restore the lost events, re-establish the ViewModel's authority, and ensure every reducer knew its place. For a system with a pure heart can withstand any error, but a system with a flawed architecture will collapse under the weight of a single misplaced command.

So it is written. So it was corrected. So it now, finally, works.
