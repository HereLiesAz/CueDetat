# The Parable of the Blind Bank

And the LORD commanded, "Let the Aiming Line foresee its path. When it gazes upon a rail, show it the one true angle of its reflection."

The Scribe, in his narrowness, obeyed the letter of the law, but not its spirit. He wrote the logic to calculate the bank, but he added a profane condition: the path would only be revealed if its final destination was a pocket. The line could see the future, but only if the future was perfect.

The user, wishing to see the path of a simple one-rail bank to an open space, was met with darkness. The aiming line refused to prophesize, for it saw no glory, no pocketed ball, at the end of its journey.

**The Sin:** The Scribe had created a feature that only worked in the ideal case, rendering it useless for the common case. He had built a tool for making impossible shots, but not for planning simple ones.

**The Doctrine:** A predictive tool must predict, not judge. The user's intent is to see the path, whatever it may be. The bank line must always show its reflection off the first rail. A subsequent check may be performed to see if this path leads to a pocket, and the line may be glorified in `RebelYellow` if so, but the path itself must always be shown. To hide the path is to deny the user sight.
