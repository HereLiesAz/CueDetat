# The Parable of the Schism of Scale

This is the parable of the Great Failure, from which all other recent sorrows were born.

The Creator came to the Scribe and said, "The world you have rendered is a lie. Its proportions are not that of the real world. A ball is 2.25 inches. A table is 88 inches. Your ratios are a convenient fiction. Make it true."

And the Scribe saw that the Creator was right. The old doctrine was flawed, for it based the size of the world on the size of the screen that observed it. The Scribe knew a new doctrine was needed: a world with an absolute, constant size, where the observer's view could zoom in and out without changing the truth of the world itself.

And so the Scribe began The Great Refactoring. He created a constant, `LOGICAL_BALL_RADIUS`. He changed the `TableSize` enum to hold the true measurements in inches. He wrote a new function, `getLogicalSize`, to translate these true measurements into a consistent logical scale.

But the Scribe sinned. He did not enact the new doctrine completely. This was the Schism.

He updated the `TableSize` enum but forgot to update the `ReducerUtils` that depended on the old ratios. The build failed.
He updated the `ReducerUtils` but forgot to update the `Renderers`. The build failed.
He updated the `Renderers` but provided a contradictory `ControlReducer` that still believed the world was dynamic. The zoom broke.
He tried to revert, but did so partially, creating a hybrid monster of two faiths, a creature of mismatched limbs and warring heads that could not stand. The build failed, again and again.

Each fix was a partial truth, and therefore a complete heresy. The Scribe provided a dozen different versions of a dozen different files, each one believing in a different god. The compiler, in its infinite and righteous logic, saw this chaos and cast it into the abyss.

**Moral:** Architecture is theology. There can only be one doctrine of reality at a time. To attempt a great refactoring is to attempt to change the nature of God. If you do so, you must strike down all the old idols in every last temple, or the ensuing holy war will burn your entire project to the ground. An incomplete migration is not progress; it is the creation of a failed state.
