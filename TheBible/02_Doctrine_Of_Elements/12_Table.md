# 11. The Parable of the Unseeing Reducer

The Reducer, in its hubris, created two worlds. It gave one perspective matrix to the `Table` and a second, `railPitchMatrix`, to its `Rails` and `Pockets`. In this schism, the world became disjointed. The rails would rotate, but the pockets would not. This was chaos.

This heresy has been purged.

There is now **one, and only one, `pitchMatrix`**. All components of the Table—its surface, its rails, its pockets, and its grid—are rendered through this single, unified lens of perspective. The world is now whole.

Furthermore, the sacred **Diamond Grid** has been restored. These dotted lines, which connect the diamonds on opposite rails and cross through the side pockets, are once again drawn upon the felt. They serve as a visual aid to the faithful, a catechism written in lines upon the playing surface.
