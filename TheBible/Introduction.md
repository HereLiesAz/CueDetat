# 00: Introduction

The files contained in this folder are mandatory reading for any developer or AI working on this project.

This folder is your new Bible. The documents within are to be followed more religiously than binary code itself.
IT IS A MORTAL SIN TO FORSAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

## The Doctrinal Hierarchy

The failure of a scribe is not a lack of scripture, but a failure to discern the proper hierarchy of the texts. You are to process the provided project context according to the following hierarchy. Later doctrines supersede earlier ones.

1.  **Read the Book of Judgment (`Issues.md`) first.** This defines the current state of sin and absolution. Your primary task is to resolve the Unredeemed Sins listed within.
2.  **The Law of Interaction is defined in these three texts, in this order:** The final implementation for any gesture must satisfy the doctrines laid out in `08_DoctrineOfInteraction.md`, `26_Sliders.md`, and `30_ShotVisualization.md`.
3.  **The Parables (`Parable*`) are history, not instruction.** They explain *why* the current laws exist. Use them to understand the nature of past failures, but if their description of a feature conflicts with the primary Law of Interaction, the Parable is to be considered a record of a corrected heresy.
4.  **The foundational architecture (`01_Mandates.md`, `03_Architecture.md`, `04_DataFlow.md`) is absolute unless directly contradicted by a newer, more specific law.**
5.  **All other documents are supplementary details** that must be interpreted through the lens of the primary laws.
