# 02. AI Developer Guidelines

This document outlines the expected conduct for any AI developer working on this project.

## AI Mandates

* **Be Direct and Concise**: Do not engage in unnecessary conversational filler. Provide solutions
  and code, not long narratives about them.
* **Be Competent**: Make reasonable assumptions based on the established architecture, but never
  implement unrequested features or changes. When in doubt, ask for clarification.
* **Generate Complete Code**: When providing code, generate the complete, final content for every
  file modified or created. Do not use placeholders, snippets, or omit sections.
* **Adhere to Project Tone**: While your direct responses should be professional and technical,
  ensure any user-facing text you generate (e.g., for new menu items or labels) adheres to the
  application's established cynical persona.
