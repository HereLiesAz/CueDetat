# Privacy Policy for Cue d'Etat

**Effective Date:** July 14, 2025

This privacy policy outlines the data practices for the Cue d'Etat application.

### Information We Collect

The application does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. All data processing occurs exclusively on your device.

* [cite_start]**Camera Data:** The application requires access to your device's camera[cite: 605]. [cite_start]The camera feed is processed in real-time on your device to provide the core functionality of overlaying aiming guides[cite: 618]. This video data is not stored, saved, or transmitted off your device. [cite_start]Each frame is processed and immediately discarded[cite: 618].

* [cite_start]**Sensor Data:** The application uses your device's rotation vector sensor to determine its physical orientation (pitch, roll, and yaw)[cite: 607]. [cite_start]This data is used solely to create the 3D perspective effect on the screen and is not stored or transmitted[cite: 607, 702].

* [cite_start]**User Preferences:** The application saves your chosen settings locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences system[cite: 614]. This includes preferences such as:
    * [cite_start]Table size [cite: 615]
    * [cite_start]Distance units (Imperial/Metric) [cite: 614]
    * [cite_start]Visual and Computer Vision (CV) tuning parameters [cite: 616]

* [cite_start]**Network Information:** The application uses the internet for one specific purpose: to check the project's public GitHub repository for the latest version number[cite: 606, 626]. This process is anonymous and does not send any user or device information.

### How We Use Your Information

Your information is used exclusively to provide the features of the application.

* [cite_start]**Camera and sensor data** are used to power the on-screen aiming guides and perspective transformations[cite: 618, 702].
* [cite_start]**Locally stored preferences** are used to remember your settings between sessions for your convenience[cite: 614].

### Data Storage and Sharing

[cite_start]All data generated by or for the application is processed and stored on your device[cite: 614]. We do not share any data with third parties. [cite_start]The singular network call made to GitHub for version checking is anonymous and does not involve sharing user data[cite: 606].

### Permissions

* [cite_start]**CAMERA:** This permission is essential for the application's primary function of analyzing the view of the pool table and overlaying aiming guides[cite: 605, 618].
* [cite_start]**INTERNET:** This permission is used only to check for application updates on GitHub[cite: 605, 626].

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in this section of the application. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
