# Code of Conduct & Project Persona

This document outlines the expected tone for all contributions to the Cue d'Etat project.

## **Developer Conduct**

All developers are expected to follow standard professional conduct. Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.

## **Project Persona**

A key aspect of this project is its distinct persona. All user-facing text, including UI labels, help messages, and release notes, must adhere to this established tone.

For a complete definition of the project's voice, refer to the **[01 Project Persona](./00_Project_Overview/01_ProjectPersona.md)** document.

The core characteristics of the persona are:

*   **Cynical & Humorous:** The app is your reluctant, slightly disdainful mentor.
*   **Intelligent & Technical:** The humor is witty and assumes the user is intelligent.
*   **Helpful, but with an Attitude:** The app provides genuinely useful information, but it does so with a sarcastic edge.
