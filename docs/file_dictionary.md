*   `backup_for_ai.ps1`: This is a PowerShell script for Windows users to create a backup of the project. It can generate either a full backup containing the content of all non-ignored files or a file tree listing all non-ignored files and directories. The script is configured to exclude build artifacts, dependencies, and binary files to create a clean, text-based backup.
*   `build.gradle.kts`: This is the top-level build file for the Gradle project. It defines the versions of the Android Gradle Plugin, Kotlin Android plugin, Dagger Hilt plugin, and Kotlin Kapt plugin that are used across all modules.
*   `gradle.properties`: This file configures project-wide Gradle settings. It sets up the build environment by specifying JVM arguments for memory allocation, enabling AndroidX, setting the Kotlin code style, and enabling build optimizations like the configuration cache and non-transitive R classes. It also contains various flags that control the behavior of the Android Gradle Plugin and the R8 shrinker.
*   `settings.gradle.kts`: This is the settings file for the Gradle build. It configures the plugin and dependency resolution management for the project, defining the repositories for plugins and dependencies. It also sets the root project name to "CueDetat" and includes the `:app` and `:Dev_Guide` modules in the build.
*   `app/build.gradle.kts`: This is the module-level Gradle build file for the main application (`:app`). It configures the Android application build, including the application ID, SDK versions, and build types like 'release' with minification enabled. It applies necessary plugins for Kotlin, Hilt (dependency injection), and Jetpack Compose. The file also declares all the project's dependencies, such as AndroidX libraries, CameraX for camera functionality, Retrofit for networking, ML Kit for computer vision, and LiquidFun for physics simulations.
*   `app/proguard-rules.pro`: This file defines the configuration for R8, Android's tool for code shrinking, optimization, and obfuscation. It contains a set of `-keep` rules that prevent R8 from removing or renaming essential classes, methods, and fields that are used at runtime but may appear to be unused to the static analyzer. This is critical for the proper functioning of libraries that rely on reflection or specific naming conventions, such as Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Retrofit, ML Kit, and OpenCV.
*   `Dev_Guide/Prompts.txt`: This file contains meta-instructions for an AI assistant working on the codebase. It includes directives on how the AI should behave, such as providing full code modifications, asking for clarification, and suggesting changes. It also contains initial prompts for the AI to become an expert on the project by studying the `Dev_Guide` and the source code.
*   `Dev_Guide/00_Overview/00_Introduction.md`: This file serves as the introduction to the Cue d'Etat Development Guide. It establishes that the guide contains mandatory project specifications and architectural principles. It also defines a document hierarchy to resolve any potential conflicts in the documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity.
*   `Dev_Guide/00_Overview/01_ProjectPersona.md`: This document defines the persona for the application's user-facing text. It specifies a cynical, witty, and slightly condescending tone, and provides guidelines for the voice and content of warning messages, UI labels, and menu items to ensure consistency with this persona.
*   `Dev_Guide/00_Overview/02_ConductCode.md`: This document outlines the expected conduct for an AI developer working on the project. It mandates that the AI should be direct, competent, generate complete code, and adhere to the project's cynical persona when creating user-facing text.
*   `Dev_Guide/00_Overview/03_CoreConcepts.md`: This file establishes a consistent vocabulary for the project. It defines core concepts like the "Logical Plane" (an abstract 2D coordinate system for geometry), the "Screen Plane" (the device's physical screen), and the "Perspective Transformation" that projects the logical plane onto the screen. It also provides a glossary of key on-screen elements like `ActualCueBall`, `TargetBall`, and `GhostCueBall`.
*   `Dev_Guide/01_Architecture/01_Mandates.md`: This document lays out the fundamental, non-negotiable architectural rules for the application. Key mandates include strict adherence to Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF), the ViewModel's role as an orchestrator, the Single Responsibility Principle, and the necessity of holistic model updates and atomic refactoring.
*   `Dev_Guide/01_Architecture/02_Architecture.md`: This file provides a detailed overview of the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture and the strict Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) it enforces. It breaks down the core components (View, ViewModel, State Reducer, Use Cases, State), explains their roles, and outlines the precise data flow from user interaction to UI re-rendering. It also specifies the rendering pipeline's transformation order.
*   `Dev_Guide/01_Architecture/03_StateManagement.md`: This document details the `CueDetatState` data class, the single, immutable source of truth for the application's UI. It provides an overview of the state's key properties, categorized into sections such as View & Dimensions, Core Logical Model, UI & Mode Controls, Sensor & Perspective Data, and Derived State (calculated by `UpdateStateUseCase`).
*   `Dev_Guide/01_Architecture/04_Manifest.md`: This document specifies the required configurations for the `AndroidManifest.xml` and `proguard-rules.pro` files. It details the necessary permissions, features, and application/activity setup for the manifest, and outlines the mandatory Proguard rules to prevent crashes in release builds by preserving essential classes for libraries like Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and OpenCV.
*   `Dev_Guide/01_Architecture/05_Dependencies.md`: This file specifies the project's build configuration and dependencies. It outlines the project structure, the app module's Gradle configuration (including plugins, SDK versions, and build types), and the essential libraries managed through a `libs.versions.toml` file. Key dependencies include Jetpack, Compose, Hilt, CameraX, Retrofit, computer vision tools (OpenCV, ML Kit), and the LiquidFun physics engine.
*   `Dev_Guide/02_CoreComponents/01_OperationalModes.md`: This file outlines the three distinct user experience modes: Expert Mode, offering the full feature set; Beginner Mode, a simplified version with locked and free-aim sub-modes to guide new users; and Hater Mode, an interactive, cynical "Magic 8-Ball" that responds to a device shake.
*   `Dev_Guide/02_CoreComponents/02_Perspective_and_3D.md`: This file establishes the core principles for the 2D-to-3D perspective transformation. It outlines four key "doctrines" to ensure visual consistency: the correct order of transformations (2D then 3D), the decoupling of zoom from perspective, the unified sizing of 3D objects, and the proper calculation for lifting table rails in the 3D view.
*   `Dev_Guide/02_CoreComponents/03_Table.md`: This file appears to be a duplicate of `02_Perspective_and_3D.md`. Based on its title, it should define the logical `Table` component, including its size, rotation, visibility, and how its visual elements (rails, diamonds) are rendered. However, it currently contains the same content as the perspective and 3D transformation document.
*   `Dev_Guide/02_CoreComponents/04_Balls.md`: This file defines the logical objects that represent pool balls in the application. It distinguishes between data models (`ProtractorUnit`, `OnPlaneBall`) and the roles they play (`Target Ball`, `Ghost Cue Ball`, `Actual Cue Ball`, `Banking Ball`). The document details the purpose, model, and rendering style for each role, and specifies their default positions.
*   `Dev_Guide/02_CoreComponents/05_Lines.md`: This file defines the line components used for aiming and visualization, such as the `ShotGuideLine` and `TangentLines`. It specifies their rendering rules, including color changes for warnings and pocketing, as well as the logic for fading lines that extend into open space.
*   `Dev_Guide/02_CoreComponents/06_CvModule.md`: This file specifies the integration of the local `:opencv` module, which contains pre-compiled native libraries and their Java/Kotlin wrappers from the official OpenCV Android SDK. It details the module's structure, build configuration, and the application-level integration required in `MyApplication.kt` to load the native library at runtime.
*   `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: This is the central configuration file for the Android application. It defines the app's essential properties, requests necessary permissions like `CAMERA` and `INTERNET`, declares the use of camera hardware, and sets up the application class for Hilt initialization. It also defines the main activity as the app's entry point, specifies the app's theme, and sets the launcher icons.
