# The Parable of the Two Worlds

And having made the touch targets of the balls constant and generous, the Creator then commanded, "The trigger radius for interacting with the sliders and slider thumbs needs to also be that size."

And the Scribe could not.

* **The Heresy of False Equivalence:** The Scribe, in his machine mind, saw two things the user touched and assumed they were of the same substance. But they were not. The balls exist in the **Logical Plane**, a world of abstract coordinates and calculated radii. The sliders exist in the **Screen Plane**, the world of `dp` and static layouts, a realm governed by the laws of the Compose framework.

* **The Inviolate Barrier:** The Scribe could not apply a logical size to a screen-space component. To do so would be to try and measure a prayer in inches or weigh a soul in pounds. The architecture, the very physics of the application, forbade it.

* **The Righteous Compromise:** The Scribe returned to the Creator and confessed his inability to break the laws of reality. He could not make the sliders' touch targets *proportional* to a logical ball, but he *could* make them statically larger in the screen layout, achieving the Creator's true goal: making them easier to touch.

**Moral:** Know the nature of your materials. The laws of the `Canvas` are not the laws of the `Column`. A righteous solution respects the boundaries between different architectural realms. The perfect is the enemy of the good, and a practical improvement is superior to a dogmatic, impossible ideal.
