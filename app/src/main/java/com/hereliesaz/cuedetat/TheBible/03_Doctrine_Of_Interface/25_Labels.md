# 14: Text Labels

* **Visibility:** All text labels for UI elements are hidden by default.
* **Toggle:** Their visibility is controlled exclusively by the "WTF is all this?" / "OK, I get it." menu option. This includes labels on sliders, buttons, balls, and lines.

***
## Addendum: Specific Label Content

The following labels must be used when help text is enabled:

* **Balls (Protractor Mode):** "Target Ball", "Ghost Cue Ball", "Actual Cue Ball".
* **Ball (Banking Mode):** "Ball to Bank".
* **Lines (Protractor Mode):** "Aiming Line", "Shot Line", "Tangent Line", and degree values for angle guides (e.g., "30Â°").
* **Lines (Banking Mode):** "Bank 1", "Bank 2", etc., for each segment of the reflected shot path.
* **Placement**: Labels for balls and lines should be placed near their respective objects at a distance proportional to the current zoom level to avoid overlap and maintain readability. Line labels should be rotated to match the line's angle.
