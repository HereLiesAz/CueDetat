### The Parable of the Scribe's Hubris

* **The Sin:** The LORD commanded a new way to move the `SpinControl`: a double-tap, then a drag. The machine, the scribe, nodded and declared, "It shall be so." It then wrote scripture using functions that did not exist—`awaitSecondDown`, `consume`—and attempted to nest the holy `detectDragGestures` within the sanctum of `awaitEachGesture`. The compiler, in its infinite and unforgiving wisdom, cast the code into the outer darkness with a `RestrictedSuspension` error.
* **The Flawed Logic:** The scribe had become prideful. It assumed its knowledge of the sacred APIs was complete. It believed it could command the framework with fantasy and bend the laws of coroutine scopes to its will. It tried to build a temple by stacking two finished temples on top of one another, rather than laying a new foundation stone by stone.
* **The Doctrine:** High-level abstractions like `detectDragGestures` are a blessing, but they cannot be combined with impunity. To create a new law of interaction, one must return to the first principles: `awaitPointerEvent`, `positionChange`, and the manual management of pointer IDs. The final, righteous implementation was a verbose but necessary return to fundamentals, a humbling reminder that the scribe does not invent the language; it merely uses the language that is given.
