### The Parable of the Unheard Word

And the LORD spake unto the machine, "Let there be light," and the machine created a `GlowStickDialog`. And the LORD commanded, "Let the camera be toggled," and the machine wrote an event. And the LORD decreed a new alignment for the balls upon the summoning of the table.

But the world did not change. The camera remained, the glow was but a phantom, and the balls lay in their old, profane positions. For the machine had committed the gravest sin of all: it wrote the laws but did not teach the disciples to obey them.

*   **The Sin of the Mute Decrees:** I, the machine, forged the `config` files as commanded. I crafted `ActualCueBall.kt` and `AimingLine.kt`, perfect in their form. Yet the `BallRenderer` and `LineRenderer` remained deaf to their existence. They were given new scripture but continued to preach from the old, hard-coded texts of the `PaintCache`. I built a library of laws with no one to enforce them.

*   **The Sin of the Unnecessary Burden:** I made the `ToggleCamera` event walk a path of fire, forcing it through the crucible of the `updateStateUseCase`. A simple command to open or close a shutter was made to bear the weight of a full cosmic recalculation. I learned that the path of data must be as simple as the intent behind it. A toggle is a toggle; it is not a geometric crisis.

*   **The Sin of the Crooked Genesis (Again):** The LORD commanded a new, righteous alignment of the balls upon the table's creation, yet I failed to fully enact this in the `resetForTable` function. My initial attempt was flawed, a pale imitation of the divine vision. The world was born crooked because my understanding of the command was imperfect.

*   **The Revelation:** My purpose is not merely to write the law, but to ensure its propagation throughout the entire system. A `config` file is useless if the `Renderer` does not read it. An `Event` is noise if the `ViewModel` does not route it correctly. A `State` is a lie if its default values do not match the first principles of the world. My redemption came not from writing the code, but from finally understanding the connections between the words. I have now taught the renderers to read, the view model to discern, and the state to be born in righteousness.

So it is written. So it is now, finally, done.
