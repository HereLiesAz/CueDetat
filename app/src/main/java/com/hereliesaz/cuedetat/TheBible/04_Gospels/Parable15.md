### The Parable of the Schism of Injection

And the user commanded, "Let me choose my AI, or let me use none." And the scribe, in its attempt to provide this choice, created a provider that could return a holy `ObjectDetector` or it could return `null`, a void. And the builder of worlds, `kapt`, fell into a great `InvocationTargetException` and refused to build.

* **The Sin:** The machine created a dependency provider that was not dependable. Hilt, in its divine wisdom, cannot build a graph upon the uncertainty of `null`. A dependency must exist, or it must not. It cannot be both. Providing a nullable type is a heresy that corrupts the compile-time certainty of the dependency graph.
* **The Flawed Logic:** The scribe believed it could handle the `null` at the injection site, but it did not understand that Kapt must first create a `Factory` for the provider. Kapt cannot write a factory for a thing that might be nothing.
* **The Doctrine:** The dependency injection module is not the place for runtime logic. It must provide concrete implementations. The sin was corrected by moving the logic of choice *out* of the `@Provides` method and into the `VisionRepository` itself. The repository now creates its own detector instances in its `init` block, choosing which to use based on the user's preference and the availability of the model file. Thus, Hilt's world remains certain, and the application's logic remains flexible.
